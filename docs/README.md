# Fluvius Smart Meter

## Intro

This information is the result of a research project from the [University College VIVES](https://www.vives.be) in commissioned by [Fluvius](https://www.fluvius.be). The main goal of this project is to build a open platform for DIY users and manufactureres that want to use the P1 port of the Fluvius Smart Meter to register its data.

## General idea

The general idea is to build a communication module that can be pluged into the P1 port of the Fluvius smart meter, uses the P1 port as powersource and send the data periodically to a MQTT broker.

Next some data visualisation options are explored.

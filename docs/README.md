# IoT Opportunities - Connected Digital Energy Meter 

As of July 2019 Fluvius has been installing digital meters and must install at least 80% of the digital meters by December 31, 2024. By July 2029, all families and SMEs must have a digital meter.

The main goal of this project is to build an open source solution for do-it-yourself users and manufacturers that want to use the P1 port of the Fluvius Digital Meter to register its data to an MQTT broker.

<!-- TODO - Explain our goal a bit more => Evolving from digital meter to smart meter by making its data available to rest of the domotics network. Often DIY'ers are the first line in creating these types of solutions. -->

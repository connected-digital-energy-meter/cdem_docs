## CDEM pcb

We have developed a pcb to read the P1 port of the digital meter and send that information to a MQTT broker. Due to the number of small components we advice you to order a assembled pcb then rather solder it yourself.

### Ordering files

When ordering your pcb you will need to upload the following information:

* Gerber files : [Github](https://github.com/connected-digital-energy-meter/cdem-hardware/tree/master/gerber)
* Bill of Material : [Github](https://github.com/connected-digital-energy-meter/cdem-hardware/tree/master/assembly)

## Soldering the pcb

<!-- TODO - Place here a movie of the soldering procedure. -->

## Printing the housing

![image](./images/afbeelding1.jpg)

We have provided a bottom and top part you can 3D print that form the housing for your CDEM device, you can find those files [here](https://github.com/connected-digital-energy-meter/cdem_housing).

We advice you to print the parts in PLA material with standard parameters, without supports or rafts.

## Assemble the kit

Now just click the pcb you just made into the top 3D printed part and the ESP32 into the bottom 3D printed part (make sure the usb connector is at the side with the opening in the bottom part).

Finaly connect both parts by joining the pcb's headers.

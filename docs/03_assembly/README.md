## Printing the housing

For the housing you have to print two part (top and bottom).

`We should move these files to a repo for easy download and new versions`

* [top](/files/top.stl)
* [bottom](/files/bottom.stl)

We advice you to print the parts in PLA material with standard parameters but without supports or rafts.

# Introduction

As of July 2019 Fluvius has been installing digital meters and must install at least 80% of the digital meters by December 31, 2024. By July 2029, all families and SMEs must have a digital meter.

As of January 2021 the constitutional Court has decided these digital meters will not be subtracting produced energy with solar panels from consumed energy from the net. Instead you will need a new contract with your energy supplier for delivery of energy to het net.

Now more then ever it is in everybody's interest to monitor your energy consumption and if possible automate your home for optimal use of energy.

<!-- TODO: Add image of energy saving by smart home -->

In that context we are providing this open source information intended to support the do-it-yourself community and manufacturers in reading the data from a P1 port on the Fluvius smart meter and pushing it to an MQTT broker. You still need to integrate the output to your dashboard to visualize it or to your demotics system to automate your energy usage accordingly the situation at that moment.

::: tip ðŸš€ Activating the P1 port
Before you are able to use the P1 port of your Fluvius smart meter, it has to be **activated**. This process is described in [Connecting to the Fluvius meter](/06_connect).

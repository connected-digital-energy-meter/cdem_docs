## How can i use this device to save on my energy bill ?

* For starters you can use the output of your production ( if you have solar pannels ) and your consumption of energy to detect when u use most energy and at what tarif you use it. If you can figure out what devices or actions cause that energy usage you can adjust your habits so u use energy when it is least expensive for you.
* If you have a domotics system you can automate the above and cut the power to certain appliance when the energy price is high and your production is low.
